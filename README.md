## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

Won 3 National Titles for being the most cost effective & Innovative Product 

* National Runnerup 2'nd - Microsoft Imagine Cup 2022
* National Runnerup - Smart India Hackathon, Govt. of India 
* National Runner up - Meraki B-Plan Challenge

According to UN Report, We are moving towards a global food & water crisis in next 100 years if we didn't made our farming more techoadvances & make the best use of technology. 

Especially in India, the farmers are lacking the specific use of agrotech advancements and ML due to many factors
* 2G network availability 
* Lowend devices that do not support high functionality applications 
* Regular Power cutoff in most parts of areas.
* Language & Geography keeps on changing after every 100 Kms 
* No information about Agrotech infrastructure
* Delay in taking action in cases of Field fires 


The Solution:

* Building IOT Product which will even run on 2G Network and can send data seamlessly 
* ML based Irrigations recommendations using Real-Time Data.
* UI that can run on lowend devices and can be used to transfer data at an ultimate constant speed.
* Use of camera to detect pesticides in the farm and give 80% accurate analysis using the fast & low accuracy ML model (VGG16) and an ML model that give accurate result and recommendations using the same in the next hour (In the view of low speed upload)


The application was built using some key points that keep UX of Farmers in mind-
* Visible in Broad daylight 
* Using of skeleton-based model for the UI and fast rendering
* Using color coded schemes to make the use of application super easy & useful
* Use of Graphics to make the user understand the application usage


## Built With

The Hardware is built on top of an Arduino UNO Microcontroller with - 
* ESP8266 for wifi & Bluetooth communications 
* GSM/GPRS module for 2 G-based communications 
*  DHT11 sensor for temperature and humidity, FC 37 for rain sensor
* JXCT soil NPK sensor 
* MQ135 sensor for CO2 and fumes detection in case of wildfires
* â€ŽRB-1124 relay module for pump on/off
* Solar panel for self-power generations 

The Software was built on top of 
* Blazor Framework (Server Side rendering)
* Used C# as interface language
* The messaging service used is Twilio 
* Postman for API connection b/w database & hardware 
* Azure for hosting applications & databases for instant data!
