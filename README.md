According to UN Report, We are moving towards a global food & water crisis in the next 100 years if we didn't make our farming more tech advances & make the best use of technology. 

Especially in India, the farmers are lacking the specific use of agrotech advancements and ML due to many factors
* 2G network availability 
* Lowend devices that do not support high-functionality applications 
* Regular Power cut off in most parts of areas.
* Language & Geography keeps on changing every 100 kms 
* No information about Agrotech infrastructure
* Delay in taking action in cases of Field fires 


The Solution:

* Building IOT Product that will even run on a 2G Network and can send data seamlessly 
* ML-based Irrigations recommendations using Real-Time Data.
* UI that can run on low-end devices and can be used to transfer data at an ultimate constant speed.
* Use of camera to detect pesticides in the farm and give 80% accurate analysis using the fast & low accuracy ML model (VGG16) and an ML model that give accurate result and recommendations using the same in the next hour (In the view of low-speed upload)


The application was built using some key points that keep the UX of Farmers in mind-
* Visible in Broad daylight 
* Using of skeleton-based model for the UI and fast rendering
* Using color-coded schemes to make the use of the application super easy & useful
* Use of Graphics to make the user understand the application usage


## Built With
![Product Hardware](images/product.jpg)
The Hardware is built on top of an Arduino UNO Microcontroller with - 
* ESP8266 for wifi & Bluetooth communications 
* GSM/GPRS module for 2 G-based communications 
*  DHT11 sensor for temperature and humidity, FC 37 for rain sensor
* JXCT soil NPK sensor 
* MQ135 sensor for CO2 and fumes detection in case of wildfires
* â€ŽRB-1124 relay module for pump on/off
* Solar panel for self-power generations 

The Software was built on top of 
* Blazor Framework (Server Side rendering)
* Used C# as interface language
* The messaging service used is Twilio 
* Postman for API connection b/w database & hardware 
* Azure for hosting applications & databases for instant data!
